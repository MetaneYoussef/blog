# OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) : 

## Layer 1 : Physical
this layer references the physical components of the hardware used in networking and is the lowest layer that you will find.
## Layer 2 : Data Link
The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. **MAC** (Media Access Control), Inside every network-enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (**NIC**)
## Layer 3 : Network
routing & re-assembly of data
## Layer 4 : Transport
- TCP **T**ransmission **C**ontrol **P**rotoco
- UDP **U**ser **D**atagram **P**rotocol
## Layer 5 : Session
the session layer (layer 5) will begin to create and maintain the connection to other computer for which the data is destined. When a connection is established, a session is created. Whilst this connection is active, so is the session.
## Layer 6 : Presentation
the layer in which standardisation starts to take place. (protocols like http and snmp)
## Layer 7 : Application
The apps that present the info and define how you interact with it.
